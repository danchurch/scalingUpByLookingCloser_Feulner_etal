## let's get the reads from the moss project onto SRA

## a sort-of recent example on how to do this is here, on the laptop:

less /home/daniel/Documents/analyses/graham/grass-endophyte-community/SRAsubmission/submitGrahamReads.txt

## this is bioproject PRJNA1160472
## https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA1160472

## most basic question - what are we submitting?

## 1,2 - raw, passed reads from both sequencing runs
## 3 - finished nifH and 16s sequences 

## raw passing reads are where? 

## on the nanopore computer: 
/media/vol1/daniel/rawDataNanopore/NostocColonyPCRsRound2/OGZygodonHylocomiumHomalia/OGZygodonHylocomiumHomalia_baseCalled/duplexTrial/trimmed

## these have been demultiplexed. 
## the barcodes we need are:

barcode  9 16S Amblystegium 
barcode 10 16S Homalia
barcode 11 16S Zygodon
barcode 12 NifH OG Hylocomium
barcode 13 NifH OG Zygodon
barcode 14 NifH Homalia

## we also need OG hylocomium reads - these are
