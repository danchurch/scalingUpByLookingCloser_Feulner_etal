However, the challenges of documenting and quantifying the moss-Nostoc symbioses with these methods are significant. In addition to the dynamic, facultative nature of the symbiosis, Nostoc-like organisms also typically participate in complex life cycles that range from large, mature colonies (syncoenobium) to single-celled akinete (dormant cell) and hormogonium (mobile, single-trichome) life stages, with numerous intermediate stages being common (___Mollenhauer1986, Büdel2024___). It is presumably the more obvious, large-syncoenobium life-stages that are noted using standard microscopic techniques, likely under-representing the total population of Nostoc cells active within a moss at any given time. Culture of mono-algal cyanobacterial cultures from environmental samples often requires months-to-years of effort for single strains. Successfully isolated mono-algal cultures are difficult to then bring to a fully axenic state, as the EPS sheath of cyanobacteria often protects diverse co-cultured organisms (___Temraleeva2016___).  

Molecular, PCR-based methods of detection, identification and quantification present additional difficulties: the 16S rRNA (___) and dinitrogenase reductase (nifH) (___ Zehr1989___) genes are commonly used for taxonomic placement and confirmation of nitrogen-fixation competency of cyanobacteria. However, chloroplast organelles originate from endosymbiosis with a cyanobacteria (___Gould2008___), and in DNA extracted from plant microbiomes amplification of 16S rRNA from plastids often reaches much higher abundances than intended Cyanobacterial targets, in some cases more than 95% of sequenced reads (___Angel2018___,  Lobakova2025___), greatly reducing molecular detection of cyanobacteria and other prokaryotes. Full length 16S reads are highly desirable, rather than shorter sequences such as 16Sv4-region-only (___), as the systematics of Cyanobacteria and Nostocaceae are still very much in flux (___) and taxonomic identifications require as much information as possible. Slow growth rates by plant-symbiotic  The tendency for co-cultured organisms makes Sanger-style sequencing of cultures difficult or impossible, and the need for long reads precludes standard short-read Ilumina platform sequencing. NifH gene amplification is also complicated by the presence of several plant homologues of NifH (___).
